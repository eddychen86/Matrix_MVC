## Overview
---
Matrix is a sanctuary for Web3 pioneers and deep-tech enthusiasts, designed to filter out the noise of mainstream social media. We provide a pure, focused environment for high-quality discourse. Here, an on-chain credential is the only pass, ensuring a community built on expertise and shared consensus. While the platform may start with fragmented sparks of insight, we believe that as true peers connect, these unordered glimmers will form a grand and orderly matrix of thought.

## Steps
First, you need to install libman if you don't have, please enter this command line to your terminal:
```
dotnet tool install Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Cli
```
After installed libman, you need to install the dependency packages into the `www/root/lib` folder.
```
libman restore
```
