## Architecture Explanation

This project follows a layered architecture pattern, primarily using the following folders to structure the code:

*   `Controllers`
*   `Models`
*   `Data/Configurations`
*   `DTOs` (Data Transfer Objects)
*   `Services`

Here is an explanation of their roles and relationships:

### 1. `Controllers`

*   **Role**: The **Controllers** act as the entry points for incoming requests (e.g., from a web browser or an API client). They are responsible for handling user input and orchestrating the response.
*   **Function**: A controller receives a request, calls the appropriate `Service` to perform the necessary business logic, and then returns a suitable response (e.g., a web page, JSON data, or a redirect).
*   **Key Principle**: Controllers should be thin. They should not contain business logic or directly interact with the database. Their primary role is to coordinate between the view/client and the service layer.

### 2. `Models`

*   **Role**: The **Models** are the "blueprints" of the data in your application. They define the shape and relationships of your data in the C# world.
*   **Function**: A model class (e.g., `Article.cs`) defines the properties of an entity and its relationships with other entities. It's like a C# representation of a database table.

### 3. `Data/Configurations`

*   **Role**: This layer acts as the "construction manual" for the database. It defines how the `Models` are mapped to the actual database tables.
*   **Function**: Using the Fluent API, these files provide detailed instructions to Entity Framework Core on how to build the database schema. This includes setting up primary keys, defining column properties (like max length), creating indexes, and establishing default values.

### 4. `DTOs` (Data Transfer Objects)

*   **Role**: DTOs act as a "contract" or a defined shape for data that is transferred between different layers of the application, especially between the **Controllers** and the **Services**.
*   **Function**: They are simple classes that contain properties but no business logic. They are used to:
    *   Receive data from incoming requests (e.g., from a web form or an API call).
    *   Send data back in responses.
    *   Enforce validation rules using Data Annotations (e.g., `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`).

### 5. `Services`

*   **Role**: The **Services** layer is the "brain" of the application. It contains the core business logic.
*   **Function**: A service class takes a DTO from the Controller, processes it, and performs the necessary actions. This can include:
    *   Validating the data based on business rules.
    *   Interacting with the database (via the `DbContext`).
    *   Calling other services.
    *   Mapping data from a DTO to a database model (Entity) and vice versa.

### Relationship Flow (Example: Creating an Article)

1.  A user submits a new article through the UI. The request hits a **Controller**.
2.  The **Controller** receives the request data and binds it to a `CreateArticleDto`.
3.  The **Controller** passes the `CreateArticleDto` to the `ArticleService`.
4.  The `ArticleService` validates the DTO, creates an `Article` model instance, and populates it with the DTO's data.
5.  The `ArticleService` uses the `DbContext` to save the `Article` model.
6.  Entity Framework Core reads the `ArticleConfiguration` to understand how to build the SQL `INSERT` statement and writes the data to the database.

This separation of concerns makes the application easier to maintain, test, and scale.

## Code First Guidelines & Best Practices

This project follows the **Entity Framework Core Code First** approach, which means the database schema is generated from the code (Models). To maintain code integrity and avoid synchronization issues, please follow these guidelines:

### 🚨 **NEVER** modify the database directly!

**ALWAYS** use the Code First workflow when making database changes:

### Correct Workflow for Database Changes

1. **Modify the Model** first in the `/Models/` folder
2. **Update the Configuration** if needed in `/Data/Configurations/`
3. **Create a Migration** using EF Core tools
4. **Apply the Migration** to update the database

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Add a new migration after model changes
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>

# Apply pending migrations to database
dotnet ef database update

# Remove the last migration (if not yet applied)
dotnet ef migrations remove

# Check migration status
dotnet ef migrations list

# Generate SQL script from migrations
dotnet ef migrations script
```

### Step-by-Step Example: Adding a New Field

1. **Add the field to your Model:**
   ```csharp
   // In Models/Person.cs
   [MaxLength(100)]
   public string? NewField { get; set; }
   ```

2. **Update Configuration (if needed):**
   ```csharp
   // In Data/Configurations/PersonConfiguration.cs
   builder.Property(p => p.NewField)
       .HasMaxLength(100);
   ```

3. **Create Migration:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add AddNewFieldToPerson
   ```

4. **Apply Migration:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Common Scenarios & Solutions

#### 🔄 **If someone accidentally modified the database directly:**

1. Manually add the missing fields to the appropriate Model
2. Update the Configuration if needed
3. **Delete the manually added columns from the database**
4. Create a new migration: `dotnet ef migrations add RestoreCodeFirstIntegrity`
5. Apply the migration: `dotnet ef database update`

#### 🔍 **Checking for synchronization issues:**
```bash
# This will create an empty migration if everything is in sync
dotnet ef migrations add CheckSync

# If the migration is empty, remove it
dotnet ef migrations remove
```

#### 📝 **Migration naming conventions:**
- Use descriptive names: `AddUserEmailField`, `UpdateArticleConstraints`
- Use PascalCase format
- Include the action and affected entity

### Database Connection

The project uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server. Connection string should be configured in:
- `appsettings.json` for production
- `appsettings.Development.json` for development
- Or use `.env` file (with DotNetEnv package)

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Never** run direct SQL commands on the database for schema changes
- **Always** test migrations on a development database first
- **Backup** your database before applying migrations in production
- **Review** generated migration code before applying
- **Keep** migration files in version control

Following these guidelines ensures that your database schema stays in sync with your code and prevents data loss or corruption issues.
